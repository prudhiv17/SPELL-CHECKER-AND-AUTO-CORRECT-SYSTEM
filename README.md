# SPELL-CHECKER-AND-AUTO-CORRECT-SYSTEM
Implemented a spell checker in Python using dynamic programming and Levenshtein distance to propose corrections for misspelled words by identifying the closest dictionary matches. Additionally, developed an auto-correct feature using backtracking to generate and suggest corrections by exploring nearby words in the dictionary.
